I'm most intrigued by systems-level problems and how to best improve the experience of users.

I'm currently working on a [recipe](https://github.com/codysharma/recipeWebsite) database website with multiple functions - not yet deployed. I also just created a version of the [hangman game](https://codysharma.github.io/SpacemanGame/) which incorporates a random word pulled via API for solo use.
