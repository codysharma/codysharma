I'm most intrigued by systems-level problems and how to best improve the experience of users. I'm currently working on full stack inventory system using Django - not yet deployed.

Check out my projects: 

[Sharmer News](codysharma.github.io/Sharmer-News/) which pulls several APIs for a news aggregate website created via React.

[Recipe Website](https://github.com/codysharma/recipeWebsite) which uses MongoDB to create a full stack application pulling JSON data from the noSQL database. Also utilizes a JWT as a gatekeeper on functionality behind the log-in feature.

[hangman game](https://codysharma.github.io/SpacemanGame/) a version of the hangmate word game which incorporates a random word pulled via API for solo use.
